## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- 🦀 Rust and Cargo installed
- 🔑 SSH access to HPC cluster
- 📦 Git

### 🚀 Quick Start

#### 🧪 Testing Locally

1. Set up SSH access to your HPC cluster (default configuration: "grenoble.g5k").

2. Ensure you have the latest stable Rust:
    ```bash
    rustup update
    ```

3. Launch the application:
    ```bash
    cargo run --release
    ```

#### 🌐 Web Development

Build and run as a web application using WebAssembly:

1. Add WASM target:
    ```bash
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```

2. Install Trunk:
    ```bash
    cargo install --locked trunk
    ```

3. Serve locally:
    ```bash
    trunk serve
    ```
    📝 Access at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html#dev`

> 💡 Append `#dev` to skip PWA caching during development

#### 🚀 Web Deployment

1. Build for production:
    ```bash
    trunk build --release
    ```

2. Deploy the generated `dist` directory to your preferred hosting platform

> 🔥 The app supports offline functionality through service worker caching!
